                    <span class="about-title">Importance</span></h2>

                <p>One essential ecological service that insects provide is pollination.
                    By transporting pollen from the male reproductive organs (anthers) to the female reproductive organs
                    (stigma) of flowers, they aid in the reproduction of flowering plants and enable the formation of
                    seeds and fruits. </p>
                <p>One of the most significant and productive pollinators are bees. Pollination is an essential process
                    for many crops, such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts, and is carried out by honeybees, bumblebees,
                    and solitary bees.</p>
                <p>Lepidopterans, which include moths and butterflies, also make a substantial pollination contribution.
                    They are drawn to vividly colored blooms and are frequently adapted to pollinate particular plant
                    species.</p>
                <p>Roughly 75% of the food crops on the planet depend on pollination, at least somewhat. A wide variety
                    of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and oilseeds depend on pollinators to reproduce.

                <p>
                    A third of Ireland's 98 wild bee species are in danger of going extinct, contributing to the
                    reduction of pollinators. </p>
                <p>The issue is grave and needs to be addressed right now to safeguard the sustainability of our food
                    supply to prevent
                    more harm to the agriculture industry's bottom line and preserve the environment.Some wild
                    pollinator species have seen changes in range, abundance, and seasonal behaviours in recent decades
                    due to climate change. Wild pollinator species' natural habitat has been reduced because of human
                    land use changes and landscape alteration. </p>
                <p>Environmental contamination has deteriorated natural habitats at the same
                    time. Pollinators' access to food and nesting sites is frequently reduced by habitat deterioration,
                    fragmentation, and
                    destruction.

                    best things you can do for pollinators. Even plants with the label "bee friendly" can have
                    had
                    pesticide treatment.
                    Research has shown that insecticides can kill, injure, and confuse pollinators. Herbicides
                    destroy the "weeds" that are
                    essential to their diet.

                <p> You can choose from a wide variety of lovely plants that are high in pollen and nectar for your
                    garden.
                    Herbs like rosemary and thyme feed pollinators and you at the same time.
                    Bacopa and bidens make excellent bedding plants for hanging baskets and tiny containers. Don't put
                    these plants in the surrounding environment; instead, confine them to your garden. The best thing
                    you can do for pollinators outside your garden is to mow less and establish biodiversity meadows and
                    borders.</p>

                <p>Natural pollinators build their nests in the ground,

                    bare dirt, let certain areas grow wild, or drill holes 10 cm deep in unfinished wood for
                    solitary bees to create a
                    nesting site for them. To live and breed, as well as to support the growth and development of
                    the pollinators of the
                    following year, wild pollinators require secure nesting places for cover from predators and
                    protection from the
                    elements.
