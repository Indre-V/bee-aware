                    <h2 class="text-center">Importance</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>One essential ecological service that insects provide is pollination.
                        By transporting pollen from the male reproductive organs (anthers) to the female reproductive
                        organs (stigma) of flowers, they aid in the reproduction of flowering plants and enable the
                        formationof seeds and fruits. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>One of the most significant and productive pollinators are bees. Pollination is an essential
                        process for many crops, such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts, and is carried out by honeybees,
                        bumblebees, and solitary bees.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Lepidopterans, which include moths and butterflies, also make a substantial pollination
                        contribution. They are drawn to vividly colored blooms and are frequently adapted to pollinate
                        particular
                        plant species.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Roughly 75% of the food crops on the planet depend on pollination, at least somewhat. A wide
                        variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and oilseeds depend on pollinators to reproduce.

                    <p>A third of Ireland's 98 wild bee species are in danger of going extinct, contributing to the
                        reduction of pollinators. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The issue is grave and needs to be addressed right now to safeguard the sustainability of our
                        food supply to prevent harm to the agriculture industry's bottom line and preserve the
                        environment.Some wild
                        pollinator species have seen changes in range, abundance, and seasonal behaviours in recent
                        decades due to climate change. Wild pollinator species' natural habitat has been reduced because
                        of human land use changes and landscape alteration. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Environmental contamination has deteriorated natural habitats at the same
                        time. Pollinators' access to food and nesting sites is frequently reduced by habitat
                        deterioration, fragmentation, and
                        destruction.

                    are intended to destroy a variety of creatures. Refusing to use them is one of the
                    best things you can do for pollinators. Even plants with the label "bee friendly" can have
                    had
                    pesticide treatment.
                    Research has shown that insecticides can kill, injure, and confuse pollinators. Herbicides
                    destroy the "weeds" that are
                    essential to their diet.

                    for your garden. Herbs like rosemary and thyme feed pollinators and you at the same time.
                    Bacopa and bidens make excellent bedding plants for hanging baskets and tiny containers. Don't
                    put these plants in the surrounding environment; instead, confine them to your garden. The best
                    thing you can do for pollinators outside your garden is to mow less and establish biodiversity
                    meadows
                    and borders.</p>

                    solitary bees to create a nesting site for them. To live and breed, as well as to support the growth
