## Design Choices

### Typography

The font family chosen for Bee-Aware was Montserrat. This font has a high readability and makes the design look clean and simple.

### Colour Scheme

The color scheme was used based on pollinator and plant colours. Neutral off white was chosen for backgrounds. Main accent color is saffron yellow and together with liquerish brown represent the bee. The combination of greens and pale red used throughout the website in various shades for more nature inspired looks.

I have also used contrast-grid.eightshapes.com to get inspiration for possible colour combination to make the website visually attractive.
