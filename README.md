## Design Choices

### Typography

The font family chosen for Bee-Aware was 'Libre Franklin'. This font has a high readability and makes the design look clean and simple.

### Colour Scheme

The color scheme was used based on pollinator and plant colours. Neutral pale red was chosen for backgrounds. Main accent color is saffron yellow and together with liquerish brown represent the bee. The combination of green and yellow used throughout the website in various shades for more nature inspired looks.

- CSS HEX
  --saffron: #ecba04ff;
  --tea-rose-red: #efbeb7ff;
  --dark-moss-green: #606c38ff;
  --licorice: #271a16ff;

I have also used contrast-grid.eightshapes.com to get inspiration for possible colour combination to make the website visually attractive.

## Existing Features

### Navigation Bar

This webpage has navigation bar which is responsive to different screen sizes. It includes the logo of the bee which leads back to the home page.

- Desktop (>=992px)

    * The navigation bar is spread out the full width of the device with all link to different sections of the webpage.  Navigation bar is fixed so it is present while browsing the page. It also has a shade of liquorish brown for :hover effect to improve user experience.

- Small devices (<992px)
  - For small devices, the desktop navigation bar is not user friendly. For this reason, it is coded to wrap into hamburger style icon. Once user clicks on the icon, the navigation options spread across the screen of the mobile device.
